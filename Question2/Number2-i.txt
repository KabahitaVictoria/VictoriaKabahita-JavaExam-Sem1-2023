- A private modifier is a modifier that limits the access of attributes and methods to a class.
    A private attribute or method cannot be accessed outside the classes in which they are declared.

- A public modifier is a modifier which allows a class, attribute and method to be accessed everywhere, within
    and outside the class.

- A protected modifier applies only to class attributes. When an attribute is protected, it can only be accessed within
    a subclass which has inherited it from the parent class.
